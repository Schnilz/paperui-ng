    <h1>ZWave Network Diagram</h1>
    <p>The Z-Wave configuration page allows reading and writing of node configuration parameters, association groups,
        wakeup interval etc. It is designed to support manual configuration of zWave devices without having to resort
        to third party utilities to configure the network, which requires stopping openHAB.</p>
