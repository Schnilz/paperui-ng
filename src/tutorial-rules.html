    <h4>Rules</h4>
    <p>A Rule consists of a <b>Name</b>, a unique <b>ID</b> and optional <b>Triggers</b>, <b>Conditions</b> and <b>Actions</b>.
      Rules are the fundament for <i>Scenes</i> and <i>Time based actions</i>.</p>

    <img class="tutimage" src="img/tutorial/rules.png">

    <p>A binding or service, installed via the <i>Add-ons</i> screen, might add more Triggers, Conditions or Actions
      to the table.</p>

    <section class="card border-success p-3 mb-2">
      <h5>Triggers</h5>
      <p>
        Defines the events when the Rule will trigger.
        Triggers may have Outputs. You can connect those to Inputs of Conditions and Actions.

      <h5>Actions</h5>

        Defines what actions the Rule takes when it runs.

    <p>You can list, create and modify Rules on the <a href="rules.html" class="demolink">Rules</a> page.</p>

    <h4>Scripts in Rules</h4>

    <p>With <i>Rules</i>, <i>Profiles</i> and <i>Transformations</i> you can handle about 98% of your automation
      needs. Very advanced, unusual or complex scenarios might require a scripted solution though.
    </p>

    <p>A <i>Script</i> is more powerful, but also harder to edit, maintain and process for openHAB.
      Multiple programming languages are supported: Jython (Python 2.6 dialect), JavaScript, or Groovy (Java dialect).</p>
