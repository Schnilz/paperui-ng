    <h4>Items</h4>

    <p>You have your set of <i>Bindings</i> installed so far. You have added automatically discovered <i>Things</i>
      via the <i>Inbox</i> or by manually adding them and explored available <b>Channels</b> on your <i>Things</i>.
    </p>

    <p>However you do not control your devices directly via exposed Thing <b>Channels</b>. You link Channels to <b>Items</b>
      instead and control your home via Items.</p>

    <p> Items are a representation of state in the openHAB system, for example the color of the Hue light bulb
      or whether the bulb is turned on or off. Items are usually <b>linked</b> to specific channels on the Thing, but
      there can also be <b>Standalone Items</b> that only store a value or setting.</p>
    <img class="tutimage" src="img/tutorial/items_links.png">

    <p>Examples for <i>Standalone Items</i> are &hellip;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a switch that you can use to tell openHAB whether you’re home or away,</li>
      <li>a default color you want your LED strips to show when first turned on.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These <i>Standalone Items</i> are often used in automation rules, which is a topic we’ll be tackling soon. </p>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info mb-4">Items store state in openHAB</div>

    <p>If you have a programming background, Items are basically variables in your program that store a value used by
      the rest of your program. In the same way, Items store a value, which can be set by the Thing channel they’re
      linked to, the User Interface, a rule or a persistence strategy (more about those later!).</p>

    <h4>Item Types</h4>

    <p>Just like there are different types of variables in a computer program, there are different types of Items for
      all the different types of data they need to store.</p>

    <img class="tutimage" src="img/tutorial/item_types.png">

    <h4>Group items</h4>

    <p>One additional, special type of item I want to show you is the<b>Group Item.</b></p>

    <p>Group items allow you to organize several individual items into a group. This can be done to control
      multiple Item states with one Switch or Dimmer.</p>

    <figure class="figure tutimage">
      <img src="img/tutorial/group_item.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.">
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">Each light bulb is a separate Thing in the shown setup. Each
        Thing is linked to a different Dimmer Item. They are individually controllable.
        But the <code>Group:Dimmer</code> also allows them to be controlled with a single slider.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Groups can also be used to logically organize multiple related items, for instance per room in a house.</p>

    <figure class="figure tutimage">
      <img src="img/tutorial/group_logical.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.">
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">A standalone item of type Group named “Office” is used to organize all the
        devices for a room.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Create &amp; configure your Items and Group Items via the <span class="demolink">Items</span> section.</p>

    <h4>Link item</h4>

    <p>Now that you are familiar with <i>Items</i>, you need to know how to link those to <i>Channels</i>.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Head to the <span class="demolink">Things</span> screen.</li>
      <li>Click on the "Channels" link</li>
      <li>Find your <i>Channel</i> in the list and find the <i>Links</i> section</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can link your channel to an existing Item or create a new Item on the fly or even let openHAB
      create Items for all the listed channels.
    </p>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info mb-4">
      Now that you’ve learned about Things and Items and how to link them, you are already able to control
      your installation.<br>
      Skip to the tutorial section about <a href="tutorial-9.html">Control interfaces</a>
      to learn about Habpanel for example. It allows you to create a beautiful, tablet friendly user interface.
