Install Add-on from the official repository and if
enabled also from the snapshot- and legacy repository.

## Version selection

Depending on which repositories you have enabled, you
see multiple available versions. We recommend to install
the version that matches with your openHAB installation.

> A newer version contains the latest fixes but might also be completely non-functional.
> Please do not report bugs on missmatching versions!

## The Eclipse Marketplace

You need to install the [Eclipse Marketplace](#filter=org.eclipse.marketplace) add-on first.
Then you have access to all Marketplace add-ons.

The Eclipse Marketplace mostly contains closed-source
add-ons, where the openHAB developers have no access to.

Install those add-ons at your own risk and only from trusted
parties. **They can potentially contain malicous code or break your openHAB installation.**

Eclipse Marketplace add-ons are automatically deinstalled
on a version upgrade, to not run the risk of instability
for the openHAB core. (We are sorry for this inconvenience.)
