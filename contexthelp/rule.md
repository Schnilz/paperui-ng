<small>You know what an openHAB **Rule** and **Script** is, right?</small>
<small class="blockquote-footer">Your friendly [tutorial](tutorial.html) reminder.</small>

In the middle part of the screen you see the graphical rule editor.

To your very left there is a list of available rule components.
There are three different types of components. For easy navigation
they are color coded:

<ul>
<li style="background-color: #d8f6df;padding:5px"><b>Trigger</b>: Defines the events when the Rule will trigger. This is optional if you are creating a Rule that is to be called from other Rules. You can create more than one trigger.
<li style="background-color: #f4c37d;padding:5px"><b>Condition</b>: Defines the conditions under which the Rule will run when triggered. This is optional and there can be more than one condition.
<li style="background-color: #f3b7bd;padding:5px"><b>Action</b>: Defines what actions the Rule takes when it runs. This is optional (though the Rule wonâ€™t do anything) and there can be more than one Action. Actions are performed in the order they are connected.
</ul>

Just drag&drop the component from the list onto the grid pattern or double click it.

### More &hellip;

Certain [Add-ons](addons.html) add more actions and triggers to the table.

## Component configuration

Usually a component requires configuration. A specific time trigger component for example
requires you to enter the actual date/time. Click on the respective input field and edit the
value. Some configurations cannot be performed inline. Click on the *Edit* button instead.

#### Edit full

By default there are only 2 configuration parameters shown. If a component requires more,
it will show a button labeled "Edit full component". That allows you to edit the component
in a zoomed in variant.

## Connect components

Components can have *Inputs* and *Outputs*.
If you hover over an *Input*/*Output* you will see its type.
You can only connect *In/Outputs* of the same type.

<mark>Note:</mark> You can connect an *Output* to as as many *Inputs* as you want.

<hr>

<u>Example</u>: You are using the **a trigger channel fired** component to trigger a rule.
You want the rule to perform its actions only if the channel name contains "test". 
Therefore you connect the output `channelname` to the **contains text** condition component.
You enter the text "test" into the configuration field of that component.
