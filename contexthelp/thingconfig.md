<small class="blockquote-footer">Your friendly [tutorial](tutorial.html) reminder.</small>

Some *Things* offer additional configuration, next to the name
and location. A location is optional and in some user interfaces
used to group *Things*.

As soon as you hit "Save" the *Thing* will receive the new configuration and will restart
itself.
