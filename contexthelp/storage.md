openHAB internally stores your data a little different than what you see 
in textual mode representations. The [backup service](maintenance.html) however
will create files that match this format and imports same-like files again.

Change the storage association to store the data item into a different
file.

Change the storage order to move the current entry up or down for an
export. Usually storage orders are automatically determined when you
import a file.
