By applying semantic tags to your items, you will able to describe more accurately what they actually represent (an equipment, a location) as well as relations between them.

It will then become possible for clients to perform advanced queries on them, like:
<mark>”*Items* related to a certain property (Temperature) located in a certain place (Ground Floor)”.</mark>

Additionally, attributes to refer to them will be provided for you in several languages so clients won’t have to rely on the *Items*’ labels alone.

It is also an attempt at unifying how to describe and match items among different natural language “assistant” integrations like Alexa, Google etc. and avoid custom implementations of this particular problem in each of them.
