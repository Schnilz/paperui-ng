## Data snapshots

Sometimes you just want to test something out and return to your
working setup later on. Via *Data snapshots* that is possible.

Click on "Create new snapshot" to create a new snapshot.
Be aware that there is only a limited number of snapshots stored.

Restore to a previous state by clicking "Restore to last snapshot".
Please allow openHAB a bit of time to restart a few services.
<mark>Hint:</mark> All traces of your testing, wanted or unwanted, will be erased.
