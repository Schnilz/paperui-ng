Items can have meta-data associated with them.
Meta-data always belongs to a specific namespace.

Usually this is used by bindings and services,
but can also be used in *Rules* and *Scripts*.

### Example

* You can assign metadata for your light Items with values for a lux level and brightness setting
  for different modes (Party, Vacation).

* Depending on the outside lux, you can adjust lights according to the metadata for each Item.
