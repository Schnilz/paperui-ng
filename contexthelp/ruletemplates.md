The most common way to distribute *Rules* is via *Rule templates*.
You can easily instantiate a new *Rule* by using one of these
listed templates.

It is easy to create your own *Rule template*, because the process is
the same as for normal *Rules*. The important difference is only
that you define some Inputs, Outputs and Component configurations
as dynamic.

### Sharing rule templates

You can share created *Rule templates* with the community via the
share button. The *Rule template* will be copied to the official
archive, which means that if you edit your template, you need to
share it again. 

Templates are versioned and you must increase the version for 
a reshare to be successful.

### Review other templates

Templates that are published to the archive have an initial
state of "Review required". Only if a certain amount of the
community reviewed and approved a new rule template, it will
be officially made available.

### Install rule templates

<mark>Caution:</mark> Please always use *Rule templates*
from trusted sources or inspect the created Rule yourself.
Distributed *Rules* and *Rule templates* may contain *Scripts*
which have access to your operating system.
