Every object in openHAB has a unique ID, may it be a *Thing*, an *Item*, a *Rule*
or anything else. You can use the unique ID to reference an object in
*Rules* and *Scripts* and it helps you to uniquely identify an object.

For example *Items* can have the same label. If you need to select an
*Item* for linking or for sending a command after a scheduled task timed out,
you will therefore always see *Items* listed with their label and also
with their unique ID.
