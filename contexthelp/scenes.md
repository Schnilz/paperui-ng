A scene is a collection of selected *Item* states.

When you execute a *Scene* all those *Items* will
be set to the stored state.

For example a "Cooking" scene could turn on all
your kitchen lights to a dimmed value of 80% except
the serving cabinet with a value of 100% and switch
on the kitchen radio and tune in a specific channel.

Scenes can only be created and not modified later on.
Because they are internally just a normal *Rule*,
you can edit and tune a *Scene* in the [Automation](rules.html)
screen.
